                Between 1969 and 1974, and again between 1989 and 2002, Nissan produced a high performance version of its Skyline coupe called the Nissan Skyline GT-R.<br> This car proved to be iconic for Nissan and achieved much fame and success on both
                road and track.<br> The GT-R is an entirely new model, sharing little with the Skyline GT-R save its signature four round tail lights.<br> Like some later generations of the Skyline GT-R, the GT-R has all-wheel drive with a twin-turbo
                6-cylinder engine.<br> But the four-wheel-steering HICAS system has been removed and the former straight-6 RB26DETT engine has been replaced with a new V6 VR38DETT.<br> Because of the GT-R's heritage, the chassis code for the all-new version
                has been called CBA-R35,<br> or 'R35' for short (where CBA is the prefix for emission standard), carrying on the naming trend from previous Skyline GT-R generations.<br> The GT-R has also retained its Skyline predecessor's nickname, Godzilla,<br>                given to it by the Australian motoring publication Wheels in its July 1989 edition.
